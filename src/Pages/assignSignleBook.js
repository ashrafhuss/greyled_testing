                      The first time one of the authors [Katie Nelson] heard of
                      biological anthropology, she was a first-year college
                      student at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota,
                      taking her first-ever anthropology course. Before she
                      enrolled in the class she didn’t really know what
                      anthropology meant. She knew it had something to do with
                      people, but didn’t know how it all fit together. The
                      course description appealed to her, so she signed up. She
                      quickly learned that anthropology was the study of humans
                      and that it was an incredibly broad discipline that
                      included explorations of cultural diversity, human
                      origins, past human societies, and human languages, among
                      a great many other subjects. She had always been
                      interested in learning about people. She enjoyed observing
                      the different ways people interacted in public spaces,
                      like the mall or the zoo. She enjoyed learning Spanish in
                      high school and loved listening to how people who spoke
                      different languages produced different sounds. She was
                      curious about how people inherited unique characteristics
                      from their parents and was especially intrigued by
                      immigration and migration and what caused people to uproot
                      themselves and move to another part of the world. During
                      the second week of class she began to learn about
                      biological anthropology and some of the leading theories
                      for how and why ancient humans left Africa and migrated
                      throughout the world. As she sat in class, she vividly
                      remembers imagining a small group of ancient humans
                      walking barefoot together through the African savannah.
                      She imagined what they wore, what their language sounded
                      like, how they held hands, how they shared food, and so
                      on. She wondered why they were migrating and what they
                      would miss about their homeland. She was hooked on
                      anthropology!
